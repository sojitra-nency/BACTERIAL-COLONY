# MicroQuant

MicroQuant is a Python-based application used to count the number of bacteria on a given petri dish. It leverages various computer vision and image processing techniques to accurately detect and quantify bacterial colonies.

MicroQuant is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- OpenCV: A powerful computer vision library for image and video processing.
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python.
- scikit-image (skimage): An image processing library that provides a collection of algorithms for image manipulation.
- scikit-learn (sklearn): A machine learning library used for data analysis and modeling.

The application will process the image using various image processing techniques and display the resulting image with the detected bacterial colonies marked. Additionally, the total count of the bacterial colonies will be printed in the console.
